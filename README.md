# Drugstore Stock

[ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Read in Brazilian Portuguese](README.pt-br.md)

Manage your household medicine stock with Home Assistant!

Drugstore Stock is an integration (custom component) for Home Assistant. It runs on the back-end, processing and exposing stock list data as entities in Home Assistant.

To view Drugstore Stock data directly on your dashboard (Lovelace), it is recommended to also install the custom card [Drugstore Stock Card](https://github.com/BigPiloto/ha-drugstore-stock-card). This card makes it easier to visualize and manage your stock lists through the Home Assistant interface.
